Hello, 

I'm @djsanwich, a linux admininstrator.

I'm using git as IT studies/practice notebooks via private repositories. Mostly markdown documents.
Since starting my IT career in 2017, I've created, kept, copied, reformatted, & lost many notes.
This has discouraged me from investing into notekeeping. 
The best solution to date has been VisualStudioCode + git.
I hope that in the future I'll have something to contribute. To other projects, or something new.
For now I am just a student.
